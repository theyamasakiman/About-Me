              context: This project was part of my upper level user centered design course at UW. It
              focused on the need to rebuild community within the student body and focuses on a
              shared interest in food and cooking.
            </p>
            <p>
              contributions: I primarily focused on the development of the home page and its
              associated features such as search functionality and an instagram styled explore page.

              context: This project aims to further my understanding of screen responsive design. It
              combines my love for fitness with professional development goals and technical know

              contributions: This project has been my own work, aimed at developing my front end
              skills in HTML and CSS. Being my first project I heavily focused on basic concepts and
              simple features you might find in a workout app.

              context: This project looks to solve the problem of finding roommates in college for
              incoming students. A problem that I noticed at UW during the housing application was
              a lack of resources to help connect me with potential roommates. This problem extends
              to UO and OSU based on conversations I've had with friends who attend. This project
              was started with an end goal app in mind to help develop both me and my partner's
              team collaboration, swift, and prototyping skills.
            </p>
            <p>
              contributions: Using my knowledge of the user centered design process, figma, and
              other PM tools, I have helped guide my partner through the shaping process of our app.
              Currently we are still doing market research and developing a prototype for user
              testing.
