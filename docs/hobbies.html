        <h3>Snowboarding is a fantastic winter time release</h3>
        <img src="img/IMG_1699.JPG" alt="Chris snowboarding">
        <p>I have been snowboarding for four years, but started skiing when I was
        four. I really enjoy the flow of snowboarding although I am a much better
        skiier. There's not quite anything like a deep powder day.</p>

        <h3>Soccer has been a huge staple</h3>
        <img src="img/Varsity2017.jpg" alt="Chris' High school varsity team">
        <p>I have played soccer since I was in kindergarten, starting out playing
        rec. That soon developed into a competitive career that saw me promoted from
        C teams to A teams contesting state championships as well as regional
        tournaments. I still play casually to this day but two knee injuries have
        slowed me down.

        <h3>Gaming is where I learned to vent rage into my desk</h3>
        <img src="img/CSGO.jpg" alt="CSGO logo">
        <img src="img/dota2.jpg" alt="Dota 2 logo">
        <p>I have enjoyed gaming for a long time, the first game I got into was minecraft,
        but soon after titles like Clash of Clans, Dota 2, and CS:GO followed. I am only
        competitive in Dota 2, where I am in the top 80% of players worldwide.
