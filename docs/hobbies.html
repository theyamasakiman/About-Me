              Although I have been skiing since I was four, and could barely fit into a snow suit,
              I started snowboarding in 2016 due to knee problems from soccer. I came to love it as a
              friend gave me a board in an attempt to convert me. I did and still do really enjoy the flow
              of snowboarding although I am a much better skiier. I ended up buying a
              snowboard the year before I went back to skiing... I highly recommend the ultimate ride
              from Solomon.

              After a tumultuous ACL tear and years of recovery I finally built enough confidence in my
              knee to give skiing another in 2021. I smuggled my dad's new pair of skis he bought at the
              end of the last season up to Seattle and rode most of the season on his Rossignol
              Escapers. Falling back in love with skiing I decided to buy my own pair, the Holyshreds...

              I have played soccer since I was in kindergarten, starting out playing
              rec. That soon developed into a competitive career that saw me promoted from
              C teams to A teams contesting state championships as well as regional
              tournaments. I still play casually to this day but two knee injuries have
              slowed me down.

              I have enjoyed gaming for a long time, the first game I got into was minecraft,
              but soon after titles like Clash of Clans, Dota 2, and CS:GO followed. I am only
              competitive in Dota 2, where I rank in the top 10% of players worldwide.
