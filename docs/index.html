            Howdy I'm Chris Yamasaki, and if you're looking for a different one who doesn't look
            like the dashing young man pictured above I am afraid you've come to the wrong place.
            If that isn't the case then I would love to describe to you the enthralling tale of my
            life in a few short sentences!

          </p>
          <p>
            I went to Grant High School in Portland OR, where I've lived most of my life. I am
            currently attending University of Washington in Seattle, WA earning my BS in Human
            Computer Interactions (HCI) and a minor in business. I enjoy technology, being outdoors
            and good company.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you're keen to know more about me don't be a stranger and reach out to me via
            my socials by clicking on the above icons! Looking forward to hearing from you! Cheers.

          <p>
            I've completed several courses relevant to UX/UI including my upper level user Centered
            design course, web development, the calc series, as well as linear algebra. I also have
            finished all available non-Allen School CS classes related to Java. I've made deans list
            twice to date.
          </p>
          <p>
            I've just recently finished the spring quarter of my sophomore year studying Human
            Centered Design Engineering focusing on Human Computer Interactions. After completing
            the upper level User Centered Design course I feel that I have a stronger grasp on the
            challenges of UX/UI and have a firm grasp on concepts that I will be using and applying
            to the professional world.
